# GuitarHeroMatlab
This project was completed in the fall of 2019 when I was a freshmen in college.
This was a competitive class project to design a game in Matlab, I chose to make the popular game Guitar Hero.
This project ended up winning first place out of all first year engineering students at Ohio State University.
Here is a link to a demo of the project using keyboar input: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clqcNjtXHJQ
